# Stardrop Blog

Stardrop is my personal blog about the popular farming game Stardew Valley. It started out as a project for my computer science class.

## Requirements

This blog is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) which uses

```

## Development

Start the local development server:

You can then open a browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Build for production

Generate a production-ready build to the `_site` folder:

```console
